In the context of recommendation system, rating metrics are to evaluate how accurate a recommender is to predict ratings that users may give to items. Therefore, the metrics are **calculated exactly on the same group of (user, item) pairs that exist in both ground-truth dataset and prediction dataset** and **averaged by the total number of users**.\n\n#### 2.1.1 Use cases\n\nRating metrics are effective in measuring the model accuracy. However, in some cases, the rating metrics are limited if\n* **the recommender is to predict ranking instead of explicit rating**. For example, if the consumer of the recommender cares about the ranked recommended items, rating metrics do not apply directly. Usually a relevancy function such as top-k will be applied to generate the ranked list from predicted ratings in order to evaluate the recommender with other metrics. \n* **the recommender is to generate recommendation scores that have different scales with the original ratings (e.g., the SAR algorithm)**. In this case, the difference between the generated scores and the original scores (or, ratings) is not valid for measuring accuracy of the model.\n\n#### 2.1.2 How-to with the evaluation utilities\n\nA few notes about the interface of the Rating evaluator class:\n1. The columns of user, item, and rating (prediction) should be present in the ground-truth DataFrame (prediction DataFrame).\n2. There should be no duplicates of (user, item) pairs in the ground-truth and the prediction DataFrames, othewise there may be unexpected behavior in calculating certain metrics.\n3. Default column names for user, item, rating, and prediction are \"UserId\", \"ItemId\", \"Rating\", and \"Prediciton\", respectively."

The evaluation part takes ground-truth data, the actual items that users interact with (e.g., liked, purchased, etc.), and the recommendation data, as inputs, to calculate ranking evaluation metrics. \n\n#### 2.2.1 Use cases\n\nRanking metrics are often used when hit and/or ranking of the items are considered:\n* **Hit** - defined by relevancy, a hit usually means whether the recommended \"k\" items hit the \"relevant\" items by the user. For example, a user may have clicked, viewed, or purchased an item for many times, and a hit in the recommended items indicate that the recommender performs well. Metrics like \"precision\", \"recall\", etc. measure the performance of such hitting accuracy.\n* **Ranking** - ranking metrics give more explanations about, for the hitted items, whether they are ranked in a way that is preferred by the users whom the items will be recommended to.
